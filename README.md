# bachelor_sm

My wife is a big fan of the television franchise, The Bachelor, which means that I get to watch it every week. As I was watching the show I became interested in understanding how the show impacts the various contestants social media status. In order to better understand this I wrote a webscraper while watching the show with my wife that would go out to instagram every single day and store each contestants follower count in a MySQL database.

As I continue to watch the show I hope to be able to build this dataset and explore various analytics such as sentiment analysis and screen time impact on follower count. This project is solely for entertainment.

Currently there are 2 folders:
1) db
  a) This holds all relevant code to create and interact with the MySQL database that is storing the data
2) pipeline
  a) This holds all relevant files to interact with instagram and pull the follower counts
